# Slack Pull Request Review Reminder

A Github action capable of sending pull requests review reminders to any slack channel. It will post the Github names, along with links to any PR's they have been requested to review, into your desired slack channel. Let's make sure PR's are reviewed in a timely manner! If you are completely new to using Github Actions, [Start here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/using-community-workflows-and-actions)

## Pre-Reqs

You will need to create a slack app and a bot, or modify an existing one, to use this action.
To get started:

- [Create a new slack app with Node.js sdk](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_granular_bot_app=1).
- This bot will need access to the `chat:write` permission found under the `OAuth & Permissions` tab.
- Install the app to your Slack workspace. Take note of the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`.
- Invite your new bot to your desired channel via Slack slash command. From your desired channel enter `/invite @<YOUR BOT NAME>`. It should pop up automatically.
- From your github repos' `Settings > Secrets` tab, create a new secret for the bot access token. To use the workflow example below, name this secret `slackbot_token`. However you can name this anything you like.

## Sample workflow file

This action works best when used with the `schedule` trigger, but feel free to experiment! With the below configuration, you can remind your team every 5 minutes that there are PR's awaiting review! If there are no PR's with reviewers requested, no notifications will be sent.

```
name: My Workflow

on:
  # configure triggers
  schedule:
    # triggers the action every 5 minutes!!
    - cron: "*/5 * * * *"

jobs:
  action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: My Action Name

        uses: nsoto92/Hackathon-ActionBot@master
        with:
          # The name of your slack channel the bot was invited to
          channel: my_slack_channel_name
          # this is automatically generated by Github
          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          # this is the name you gave to the secret in your Github repo
          slack-auth: ${{secrets.slackbot_token}}
          # this is the on/off switch
          active: true

```
